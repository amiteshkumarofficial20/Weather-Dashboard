# Weather Dashboard Update TODO

## Tasks

- [x] Update script.js fetchWeather function to use OpenWeatherMap One Call API instead of separate /weather and /forecast calls
- [x] Use One Call data directly for current, hourly (slice to 24), and daily (slice to 7)
- [x] Update UV index from One Call data
- [ ] Test: Launch browser, search city, verify data loads reliably and forecasts display (Browser tool disabled - manual testing required)
